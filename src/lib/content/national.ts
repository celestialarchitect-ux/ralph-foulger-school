    "slug": "property-ownership",
    "intro": "Real estate licensing starts with knowing exactly what is being bought, sold, or leased — and what rights come with it.",
    "overview": [
      "Real property is land, anything permanently attached to it, the airspace above, the minerals below, and the rights that flow from ownership. Personal property (chattels) is everything else — movable, not tied to a specific parcel. The line between the two often comes down to fixtures: items installed in a way that makes them part of the real property.",
      "Courts apply five tests to settle fixture disputes (often abbreviated MARIA): Method of attachment (how is it secured), Adaptability to the property (was it custom-fit), Relationship of the parties (landlord/tenant differs from owner/buyer), Intent of the person installing it (was it meant to stay), and Agreement (what does the contract say). Trade fixtures — items installed by a tenant for business purposes — generally remain personal property and can be removed if the tenant restores any damage.",
      "Ownership is best understood as a \"bundle of rights\" — possession, control, enjoyment, exclusion, and disposition. Different forms of ownership distribute that bundle differently. A fee simple absolute holds the whole bundle indefinitely, inheritable, with no conditions. A defeasible fee adds a condition — if violated, ownership reverts. A life estate holds the bundle only for a measuring life; what happens next depends on whether there's a remainderman (named third party) or a reversion (back to the original grantor).",
      "Leasehold estates transfer possession and use to a tenant for a defined term, but the underlying fee stays with the landlord. The four main types: estate for years (fixed beginning and end), periodic estate (renews automatically — month-to-month), estate at will (terminable any time by either party), and estate at sufferance (former tenant overstaying after lease ends).",
      "Encumbrances are non-possessory claims that ride with the title. Liens (mortgages, tax liens, mechanic's liens, judgment liens) attach as security for debt. Easements give someone the right to cross or use the land — appurtenant easements run with the land (benefit a neighboring parcel), while easements in gross are personal (utility company's right to maintain power lines). Encroachments are unintended physical intrusions like a fence built over the property line; they're typically discovered by survey and can ripen into easements by prescription if left unchallenged for the statutory period.",
      "Co-ownership matters because it determines what happens at death, divorce, and creditor pursuit. Joint tenancy carries the right of survivorship — when one tenant dies, their share automatically passes to the survivors outside probate. It requires the four unities: time (acquired same time), title (same deed), interest (equal shares), and possession (each has right to whole). Tenancy in common divides ownership into separate, inheritable shares, often unequal, with no survivorship. Tenancy by the entirety (where recognized) is reserved for spouses with built-in survivorship and creditor protection on individual debts.",
      "Common-interest properties — condominiums, cooperatives, planned unit developments (PUDs), and time shares — distribute the bundle differently again. A condo owner holds fee in their unit airspace plus an undivided interest in common elements. A co-op owner holds shares of stock in a corporation that owns the building, with a proprietary lease for their unit. PUD owners hold fee in their lot plus an interest in association-managed common areas. These distinctions affect financing, taxation, and exit liquidity."

  {
    "slug": "land-use-controls",
    "intro": "Land use is shaped by both government power and private agreements. Both restrict what an owner can do.",
    "overview": [
      "Government rights in land come from four powers, often memorized as PETE: Police power (regulation for health, safety, welfare), Eminent domain (taking for public use with just compensation), Taxation (creating tax liens), and Escheat (property reverting to the state when an owner dies intestate with no heirs). These powers exist in tension with private property rights and form the foundation of land use law.",
      "Property taxes fund local services and create automatic liens that take priority over almost everything else, including earlier-recorded mortgages. Assessment is done by county assessors at a percentage of market value. Special assessments fund specific public improvements (sewer line, sidewalk) and become liens on benefited property regardless of consent.",
      "Eminent domain (the \"taking power\") lets government compel sale of private property for genuinely public use — roads, schools, utilities — but only with just compensation determined through a condemnation proceeding. Inverse condemnation occurs when government action effectively takes property without formal condemnation (e.g., severe regulatory restriction). The Supreme Court has expanded \"public use\" controversially in cases involving private redevelopment.",
      "Police power authorizes regulation for health, safety, and welfare without compensation. That's where zoning lives. Master plans set long-term land-use vision; zoning ordinances translate that vision into rules: residential vs commercial vs industrial vs agricultural districts, density limits, setback requirements, height restrictions, parking minimums, lot coverage maximums. Each county or municipality has its own zoning code.",
      "Variances and conditional uses provide narrow escape valves. A variance addresses unique hardship caused by the property itself — odd lot shape, topography — not personal hardship. Conditional uses (special permits) are uses pre-approved for the zone subject to specific conditions, like a daycare in a residential zone. Nonconforming uses (\"grandfathered\") are uses that legally pre-date a zoning change; they typically can't expand and may eventually have to be terminated.",
      "Spot zoning — singling out one parcel for treatment different from surrounding parcels — is generally unconstitutional unless the rezoning serves a genuine public purpose. Comprehensive plan amendments must usually precede major rezonings. Subdivision regulations control the division of land into lots: platting, dedication of streets to the public, infrastructure requirements, environmental review.",
      "Environmental regulation cuts across all property. CERCLA (the federal Superfund law) imposes strict, joint and several liability for hazardous-waste cleanup on owners and operators — even innocent purchasers can be on the hook. Clean Water Act regulates wetlands. RCRA covers underground storage tanks. State and local rules add layers: lead-paint disclosure for pre-1978 housing (federal), asbestos in older buildings, radon, mold, formaldehyde. An agent's role is to recognize \"red flags\" and recommend professional inspection — never to certify the absence of contamination.",
      "Private controls operate alongside public ones. Deed restrictions (\"conditions\" or \"covenants\") run with the land and bind future owners. CC&Rs (Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions) — typical in subdivisions and PUDs — govern architectural style, paint colors, fence types, parking, pets, and more. HOA rules layer on top, enforced through liens, fines, and architectural review. Race-restrictive covenants from earlier eras are unenforceable but often still appear in title chains."

    "overview": [
      "Market value is the most probable price a willing, informed buyer would pay a willing, informed seller in an arm's-length transaction with reasonable exposure to the open market. Market price is what actually changed hands — it can differ from market value when the parties are pressured, related, or uninformed. Cost is what was spent to build, which has no necessary relationship to either market value or market price.",
      "The four characteristics of value, called DUST: Demand (someone has to want it), Utility (it has to satisfy a want or need), Scarcity (limited supply), Transferability (legal ability to convey). Remove any one and value collapses. The principle of substitution underlies all valuation: a buyer will pay no more than the cost of an equally desirable alternative. Other principles like highest and best use, conformity, progression, and regression all flow from how DUST plays out in a specific market.",
      "Highest and best use is the use that is legally permissible (zoning, deed restrictions allow it), physically possible (the land can support it), financially feasible (it generates sufficient return), and maximally productive (highest residual return to the land). All four tests must be satisfied. A vacant lot in a commercial zone might have its highest and best use as a small retail building rather than as residual residential.",
      "Three approaches converge on a credible value, and an appraiser reconciles them weighted by which is most reliable for the property type. The Sales Comparison Approach (also called Market Approach) is dominant for residential — adjust recent comparable sales for differences in size, location, condition, age, features, and financing terms. The Cost Approach is best for new construction or special-use property: estimate replacement cost, subtract depreciation, add land value. The Income Approach (Capitalization Approach) is used for income-producing property: estimate net operating income, divide by a market cap rate to derive value.",
      "Depreciation in appraisal (different from tax depreciation) has three causes: physical deterioration (wear and tear, deferred maintenance), functional obsolescence (outdated features — one bathroom in a four-bedroom house), and external/economic obsolescence (factors outside the property — new freeway nearby, neighborhood decline). Each form is either curable (cost to fix is less than value added) or incurable (not economically worth fixing or impossible). External obsolescence is almost always incurable.",
      "Capitalization formula: Value = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Capitalization Rate. NOI is gross income minus vacancy/collection loss minus operating expenses. Note: mortgage payments (debt service) are NOT operating expenses for NOI purposes. Capitalization rate reflects investor risk — higher cap rate means higher perceived risk or weaker market, lower cap rate means lower risk or stronger market.",
      "A Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) is what an agent prepares — a market-derived pricing recommendation, not an appraisal. A Broker Opinion of Value (BOV) is similar but more formal, often used for commercial property. Only a state-licensed or certified appraiser may produce an \"appraisal\" for federally related transactions (most loans involving federally regulated banks). Confusing these terms is a license-law trap.",

      "A mortgage transaction has two essential documents: the note (the borrower's personal promise to repay, evidence of the debt) and the security instrument — either a mortgage or a deed of trust — that gives the lender a security interest in the property. The note is the debt; the security instrument is the collateral. Without the note, no debt exists; without the security instrument, the lender is unsecured.",
      "States are either lien-theory or title-theory. In lien-theory states, the borrower keeps title and the mortgage is a lien against it; foreclosure requires court action (judicial foreclosure). In title-theory states, the lender holds legal title until the loan is repaid, with the borrower holding equitable title; the deed of trust uses a neutral trustee and allows non-judicial foreclosure on default. Many states are hybrid.",
      "Loan types differ by how principal and interest are repaid. A term (straight) loan pays interest only with the principal due as a balloon at maturity — common in commercial. A fully amortized loan pays principal and interest in level installments that retire the loan by maturity — most residential mortgages. A partially amortized loan combines installments with a balloon at the end. An ARM (adjustable rate) ties the rate to a public index plus a margin, with periodic adjustment caps and lifetime caps. Reverse mortgages let seniors convert equity into payments; the loan is repaid when the borrower dies, sells, or moves.",
      "Mortgage insurance and government programs reduce lender risk and expand access. PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) is required when LTV exceeds 80% on conventional loans; lenders may automatically remove PMI at 78% LTV based on original schedule. FHA insures loans for borrowers with low down payments (as little as 3.5%) and looser credit; FHA mortgage insurance has both upfront and annual premiums. VA guarantees loans for eligible veterans with no PMI and frequently no down payment, capped by entitlement. USDA serves rural areas with no down payment.",
      "Mortgage clauses tested heavily: Acceleration clause lets the lender demand the entire balance immediately on default. Due-on-sale (alienation) clause lets the lender call the loan if the property is sold without consent — prevents loan assumption. Prepayment clause may include a penalty for early payoff (restricted on most owner-occupied mortgages). Subordination clause lets a lien voluntarily move to junior position to allow a senior loan. Defeasance clause states that the lien is released when the loan is paid in full.",
      "Federal disclosure laws form a tight web. RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) requires the Loan Estimate within 3 business days of application and the Closing Disclosure 3 business days before closing. RESPA Section 8 bans kickbacks and unearned fees among settlement providers. Truth in Lending (Regulation Z) requires APR disclosure and standardized loan-cost format. ECOA (Equal Credit Opportunity Act) bans lending discrimination on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or receipt of public assistance.",
      "Primary mortgage market: direct lenders making loans to consumers (banks, credit unions, mortgage bankers, brokers). Secondary mortgage market: investors buying loans from primary lenders, providing liquidity. Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) buy conventional conforming loans. Ginnie Mae (GNMA) guarantees pools of FHA and VA loans. Conforming loan limits change annually and vary by county.",

Common schemes: straw buyer (someone signs purchase docs they don't intend to honor), inflated appraisals to support fraud, identity theft, equity skimming. Predatory lending includes excessive fees, unjustified rate hikes, loan flipping, and asset-based lending without regard to ability to repay. Licensees who facilitate or fail to report obvious fraud face license sanctions plus civil and criminal liability."

    "intro": "Agency law governs every relationship between licensee and client. The exam tests it heavily; clients live or die by it.",
    "overview": [
      "Agency is a legal relationship where one person (the agent) acts on behalf of another (the principal or client) with authority to bind them in dealings with third parties. Real estate agents owe fiduciary duties — the highest duties known to law — to clients but lower duties to customers and third parties. Memorize the acronym COALD: Care, Obedience to lawful instructions, Accounting, Loyalty, Disclosure. Care plus skill, undivided loyalty, full disclosure of all material facts, accounting for funds, and obedience are the bedrock.",
      "Agency types are organized by scope of authority. A special agent has limited authority for one specific transaction — typical of a listing broker representing a seller for one property sale. A general agent has broader, continuing authority — typical of a property manager handling all aspects of rental management. A universal agent has authority to act in all matters legally allowed — power of attorney territory. Subagency exists when an agent's authority is delegated to another agent (cooperating broker working under listing broker's authority).",
      "Agency creation: An express agency is created by written or oral agreement. An implied agency is created by parties' conduct without explicit agreement — for example, an agent who consistently acts as a buyer's representative may be deemed their agent. Ostensible (apparent) agency arises when a principal's conduct leads a third party to reasonably believe an agency exists, even if it doesn't. Agency by ratification occurs when a principal accepts the benefits of an unauthorized act after the fact.",
      "Designated agency lets one brokerage assign different agents from the same firm to opposite sides of a transaction — keeping the supervising broker as a dual agent but giving each side undivided loyalty from their designated agent. Many states permit this; rules vary. Buyer agency creates a fiduciary relationship with the buyer, contracted by a buyer-broker agreement. Tenant representation similarly creates fiduciary duty to a tenant.",
      "Dual agency occurs when one agent or firm represents both buyer and seller. It's legal in most states only with written informed consent from both parties, and it eliminates undivided loyalty — the agent must act neutrally between the parties. Many states require enhanced disclosure forms before any showing or negotiation. Hawaii recognizes dual agency under HRS 467 with mandatory written consent. Misuse of dual agency — undisclosed self-dealing, biased advice, leaking confidential information — is a leading cause of license revocation and lawsuits.",
      "Fiduciary duties (COALD) explained in depth. Care: act with the diligence and skill a reasonable agent would in similar circumstances. Obedience: follow lawful instructions; refuse unlawful ones (instructions to discriminate, hide defects, etc.). Accounting: maintain accurate records of all funds and property received; deliver client funds promptly. Loyalty: place the client's interests above all others, including the agent's own interests; avoid conflicts. Disclosure: reveal all known material facts that could affect the client's decision.",
      "Agency creates duties to non-clients (customers and third parties) that are lower than fiduciary but still substantial — primarily honesty, fair dealing, and disclosure of known material defects. An agent can never misrepresent a fact regardless of who they represent. \"Puffing\" (subjective opinion: \"this is a great kitchen!\") is allowed; misstatement of material fact (\"the roof is two years old\" when it's twenty) is misrepresentation, actionable as fraud if intentional or negligent.",
      "Termination of agency happens by: expiration of the term, completion of purpose (transaction closes), mutual rescission, breach by either party, destruction of property, death or incompetency of either party (universal agency continues; for special agents, principal's death typically terminates), bankruptcy, or operation of law (changes in legal status). The agent's fiduciary duties continue post-termination for confidentiality of information learned during the agency."

      "Sellers in nearly every state must disclose known material defects in writing on a state-mandated form. The form typically asks about plumbing, electrical, roof, structural, environmental hazards, prior repairs, neighborhood conditions, and any pending claims. The agent's role is to facilitate accurate disclosure, not to certify the property's condition. If the agent has actual knowledge of a defect — water in the basement, an undisclosed addition, a foundation crack — the agent must disclose it independently, even if the seller refuses. Misrepresentation by silence is just as actionable as a lie.",
      "A material fact is anything a reasonable buyer or seller would consider important in deciding whether and at what price to transact. The standard is objective: would this matter to a typical buyer? If yes, it's material and must be disclosed if known. Material facts include known defects, boundary disputes, pending litigation, planned road construction, sex-offender notifications (Megan's Law), past flooding, prior fires, prior deaths or stigmatizing events (rules vary by state).",
      "Federal law mandates a Lead-Based Paint Disclosure (the Lead Hazard Information Pamphlet plus the Lead Disclosure Form) for all residential housing built before 1978. Buyers receive a 10-day right to inspect for lead-based paint hazards (which can be waived in writing). Failure to disclose carries per-violation federal penalties. Asbestos, radon, mold, formaldehyde, underground storage tanks, electromagnetic fields, and methamphetamine contamination are increasingly addressed via state-specific forms or general material-fact duties.",
      "Stigmatized property is property where a non-physical event (death, suicide, murder, alleged paranormal activity, criminal activity) has occurred. State rules on disclosure vary widely. Some states require disclosure if asked, others affirmatively, others not at all. HIV/AIDS-related deaths have specific federal protection — generally not disclosable. A licensee's safest stance is disclose-when-asked unless state law clearly says otherwise.",
      "An agent who relays a seller's statement is generally not liable, unless the agent knew or should have known the statement was false. The duty to investigate \"red flags\" — visible signs of potential problems like water stains, sloping floors, recent paint over one wall — is real. Agents are not inspectors and don't certify, but they can't willfully ignore obvious signs.",
      "\"As-is\" sales do not eliminate disclosure obligations. The seller is still required to disclose known material defects; the buyer simply accepts the property in its current condition, waiving the right to demand repairs. As-is is about repair allocation, not information disclosure. Many disputes arise when sellers think \"as-is\" means they don't have to talk about problems — that's wrong.",
      "Latent defects (hidden, not discoverable on reasonable inspection) and patent defects (obvious) have different treatment. Latent defects must be disclosed if known. Patent defects are presumed observed by the buyer; failure to point them out is generally not actionable. The line between latent and patent is a frequent dispute.",
      "Caveat emptor (\"let the buyer beware\") was the historical rule in real estate. Modern state disclosure statutes have largely supplanted it for residential transactions. Commercial transactions still operate closer to caveat emptor, but professional duties of honesty and material-fact disclosure remain."

    "overview": [
      "A valid contract requires four essential elements: mutual agreement (offer + acceptance, also called \"meeting of the minds\"), consideration (something of value exchanged), legal capacity of all parties, and lawful purpose. Real estate contracts must additionally satisfy the Statute of Frauds — they must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. Verbal agreements to transfer interests in land are generally unenforceable, with narrow exceptions for partial performance.",
      "An offer must be a definite, communicated proposal showing intent to be bound on acceptance. It must include the essential terms: parties, property, price, and any unique conditions. An invitation to make offers (a listing on MLS) is not itself an offer. Acceptance must be unconditional and communicated to the offeror; until then, the offeror can revoke. Conditional acceptance — accepting with changed terms — is a counteroffer that rejects and replaces the original offer.",
      "Listing agreements come in three flavors. Exclusive Right to Sell — broker earns commission no matter who finds the buyer (including the seller themselves). Exclusive Agency — broker earns commission unless the seller personally finds the buyer, in which case the broker earns nothing. Open Listing — broker earns only if their efforts produced the sale; seller can have multiple open listings simultaneously. Net listings (broker keeps everything above a stated price) are discouraged or banned in most states because of the inherent conflict of interest.",
      "Purchase agreements bind buyer and seller. Standard contingencies (escape clauses) include financing (buyer must obtain a loan within X days), inspection (right to inspect and request repairs or terminate), appraisal (property must appraise at or above purchase price), sale of buyer's current home, title (must be marketable), and sometimes attorney review. A contingency must be satisfied or waived by its deadline; otherwise the contract terminates and the deposit is typically returned.",
      "\"Time is of the essence\" makes contract deadlines strict — a single day late is a breach giving the non-breaching party remedies. Without this language, courts may grant reasonable extensions. Most modern real estate contracts include time-is-of-the-essence language; agents should never assume otherwise.",
      "Breach gives the non-breaching party remedies: specific performance (court orders the actual conveyance — typical for buyers because real estate is considered unique and damages don't fully substitute), monetary damages (lost profits, out-of-pocket costs), liquidated damages (pre-agreed amount, typically the earnest money — common for seller's remedy when buyer breaches), or rescission (cancel + restore parties to original positions). Mitigation duty: the non-breaching party must take reasonable steps to minimize damages.",
      "Modification, assignment, and termination. A bilateral modification requires consideration on both sides. Assignment transfers contract rights (and usually duties) to a third party — generally allowed unless the contract bars it or the duties are personal. Novation substitutes a new party or new contract with all parties' consent, releasing the original obligor. Mutual rescission ends a contract by agreement; unilateral termination usually requires a contractual or legal basis.",
      "Defenses to contract enforcement: lack of capacity (minors, incompetents, intoxication), duress (improper pressure), undue influence (excessive psychological pressure by trusted person), fraud, mistake (mutual or unilateral material mistake), illegality, statute of frauds violation, statute of limitations expired, and impossibility/frustration of purpose. Voidable contracts can be avoided by the harmed party (minor's contract); void contracts have no legal effect from the start (illegal purpose)."

    "intro": "Title transfers happen at closing. Master the deed types, recording, and escrow.",
    "overview": [
      "A deed is the document that transfers title from grantor to grantee. To be valid, a deed requires: a competent grantor, an identifiable grantee, a recital of consideration, words of conveyance (\"grant,\" \"convey,\" \"sell\"), an adequate legal description, the signature of the grantor (not the grantee), delivery, and acceptance. Notarization isn't required for validity but is required for recording. Recording protects the grantee's interest against later claims by giving constructive notice to all subsequent parties.",
      "Deed types differ by warranties. A General Warranty Deed offers the strongest protection — the grantor warrants against all defects of title back to the property's origin, including those before the grantor owned it. The four typical covenants: seisin (grantor owns it), against encumbrances (no undisclosed liens), quiet enjoyment (buyer won't be disturbed by superior claim), and warranty forever (grantor will defend title). A Special (Limited) Warranty Deed warrants only against defects arising during the grantor's ownership. A Bargain and Sale Deed implies the grantor has title but offers no express warranties. A Quitclaim Deed conveys whatever interest the grantor has, with zero warranty — common for clearing title clouds, transferring between family members, divorce settlements.",
      "Title at death passes by will (testate) or by state intestate succession statute (intestate). A testator must have testamentary capacity (sound mind, knowledge of property and natural heirs). Intestate succession follows a statutory order: spouse, children, parents, siblings, more distant relatives. Probate court oversees the transfer, validates wills, settles claims against the estate, and issues letters testamentary or letters of administration to the personal representative who deeds the property.",
      "Joint tenancy property passes by survivorship outside probate — no will needed for the share to pass to surviving joint tenants. Property held in trust passes per trust terms (avoiding probate). A life estate ends at the measuring life's death and either reverts to grantor or remains to a named remainderman.",
      "Title insurance protects against title defects existing at the time of closing. Two policies: an owner's policy (one-time premium, protects buyer for as long as they own) and a lender's policy (required by lender, covers loan amount, decreases as loan balance does). Standard exclusions: defects created or known by the insured, government regulations, eminent domain proceedings, mining claims, and matters not of record. Extended coverage can be purchased for some excluded items via endorsements.",
      "Chain of title is the recorded history of ownership. A title search examines the chain back to a marketable starting point. A title abstract is the summary report. Clouds are defects or unresolved claims affecting marketability — old liens not released, unsigned deeds, gaps in chain, conflicting recordings. A suit to quiet title is a court action to resolve clouds and confirm ownership.",
      "Closing combines the buyer's funds, the loan proceeds, and the deed into a single coordinated transfer. An escrow agent (or attorney in attorney-state closings) holds funds and documents and disburses on satisfaction of all conditions. Closing statements detail every credit and debit. The federal Closing Disclosure form replaced the HUD-1 for most residential mortgage loans.",
      "Prorations split shared items at the closing date — taxes, rent, HOA dues, insurance, utilities. Methods vary by state and contract: 360-day \"banker's\" year (12 × 30) or actual 365-day year. The day of closing is allocated by contract — sometimes seller pays through closing, sometimes buyer owns from closing. Conveyance/transfer taxes and recording fees are charged based on the deed value."

    "overview": [
      "Trust accounts hold other people's money — earnest money deposits, security deposits, rents collected. Commingling personal and trust funds is a license-law violation in every state. So is conversion (using trust funds for the broker's own benefit, even temporarily). Trust accounts must be properly identified (\"Trust Account\" or \"Client Trust Account\"), held at a state-approved depository, reconciled regularly (typically monthly), and with records retained for the period state law requires (commonly 3 years). Even accidental commingling — depositing a personal check that should have gone elsewhere — can trigger disciplinary action.",
      "The Federal Fair Housing Act (1968) and its amendments prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of seven protected classes: race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (presence of children under 18), and disability. Hawaii and many other states add additional protected classes — Hawaii's HRS 515 includes ancestry, age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, HIV/AIDS status, and source of income. Civil Rights Act of 1866 separately protects race in all property transactions.",
      "Discriminatory practices that violate fair housing: refusal to sell or rent, different terms or conditions, false statements about availability, blockbusting (inducing sales by representing protected-class entry), steering (channeling buyers to or away from neighborhoods based on protected class), redlining (refusing to lend or insure in certain areas), discriminatory advertising. ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) covers accessibility in commercial property.",
      "Advertising rules require: identifying the firm by name, distinguishing \"agent\" from \"broker\" titles per state law, avoiding misleading claims, not falsely advertising as the listing broker, never soliciting a property currently under exclusive agreement with another broker. \"Truth in advertising\" applies equally to print, MLS, internet, social media, and email. Many states require specific language for licensees (\"each office independently owned and operated\").",
      "Supervision: brokers are responsible for the acts of their licensees. Failure to supervise can revoke the broker's license even if the agent's violation was unilateral. Independent contractor status (typical in real estate for tax purposes) does NOT reduce the broker's license-law supervisory duty. Brokers must have written policies covering trust accounts, advertising, fair housing, dispute resolution, and ongoing training.",
      "Antitrust law (the federal Sherman Act) bans price fixing — brokers agreeing on commission rates is a per se violation, no defenses. Market allocation (geographic carve-ups: \"you take the east side, I'll take the west\") is also per se illegal. Group boycotts (brokers agreeing to refuse dealings with another firm) are per se illegal. Tying arrangements (forcing customers to buy one product to get another) are scrutinized. The phrase \"What's the going commission rate?\" must be answered with \"commissions are negotiable\" — a market-rate quote could be construed as evidence of conspiracy.",
      "Procuring cause is the agent who initiated the unbroken chain leading to a sale. Determines commission entitlement when more than one agent has been involved. The party that \"introduced\" the buyer to the property is generally the procuring cause, but the chain can be broken by abandonment, by the buyer's genuine independent action, or by the listing broker's acceptance of cooperation from a different agent.",
      "Ethics: NAR Code of Ethics binds REALTOR® members (a voluntary professional designation), not all licensees. State license law sets the legal floor; NAR Code is generally higher. Practicing within area of competence is a near-universal duty. Avoiding the unauthorized practice of law (UPL) is critical — agents can fill in standard form blanks but cannot draft contracts, give legal advice, or interpret legal documents."

      "Property management is general agency. The property manager (PM) collects rent, maintains the property, handles tenants, and remits net income to the owner. Common compensation: percentage of rents collected, sometimes flat monthly fee, often with leasing commissions for new tenants. The PM owes fiduciary duties to the owner. Tenant screening must comply with fair housing — same protected classes, same prohibitions.",
      "Common-interest ownership covers four main types. Condominium: fee ownership of unit airspace plus undivided interest in common elements (lobby, grounds, roof). Cooperative (co-op): own shares of stock in a corporation that owns the building plus a proprietary lease for your unit. Planned Unit Development (PUD): fee in your individual lot plus interest in association-managed common areas (pools, parks, streets). Time share: right to occupy a unit for a defined period each year, typically a week.",
      "Each common-interest type has different financing, taxation, and exit characteristics. Condos are mortgageable like any single-family. Co-ops require unique loan products (share loans) since you don't own real property — many lenders won't finance them. PUDs finance like single-family. Time shares often finance through the developer at higher rates and are notoriously hard to resell.",
      "Subdivisions split a parcel into lots for sale or development. State subdivision laws regulate platting (recorded survey of lots, streets, easements), dedication of streets to the public, infrastructure requirements (water, sewer, drainage), environmental review, and disclosures. The federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act covers cross-state sales of unimproved lots in larger developments — requires registration with HUD and detailed property report disclosure to buyers.",
      "Commercial / income property analysis differs from residential: focus is income-generating ability. Cap rate, NOI, debt service coverage ratio (DSCR = NOI ÷ annual debt service), and lease terms drive value. DSCR below 1.0 means insufficient income to cover debt. Lenders typically require 1.20 or higher.",
      "Lease types: Gross lease — tenant pays rent only, landlord pays operating expenses. Net lease — tenant pays rent + some operating expenses (single, double, or triple net depending on number of categories). Triple-net (NNN) lease shifts taxes, insurance, and maintenance to tenant — common in retail and industrial. Percentage lease — tenant pays base rent + percentage of sales over a threshold; common in retail. Ground lease — tenant rents land, often building their own structure on it; common in fast food and infill commercial.",
      "Industrial property involves additional considerations: zoning compatibility, environmental contamination history (especially if prior uses were industrial), loading dock access, ceiling clearance, power capacity, rail or freeway proximity, and labor pool. Specialized due diligence is essential.",
      "Investment metrics beyond cap rate: cash-on-cash return = annual cash flow before tax ÷ cash invested (after debt). Internal Rate of Return (IRR) considers timing of cash flows and reversion (sale proceeds) at end of holding period. Equity multiplier = total return ÷ initial equity. These help compare investments with different financing structures."
