// Tough question bank — additional Hawaii-style "gnarly" PSI prep questions

//   - Double negatives ("which is NOT an exception...")
//   - "Most likely" / "primary" / "best" between two technically-true options
//   - Long scenarios with red-herring data
//   - Hawaii-specific edge cases (HARPTA, leasehold, HRS 514B, Land Court)
