    "intro": "Hawaii has unique disclosure obligations rooted in its land history, leasehold prevalence, and tax rules.",
    "overview": [
      "Hawaii has two parallel land-recording systems that every licensee must understand. The Bureau of Conveyances (BOC) handles \"Regular System\" recordings — the standard county-style chain-of-title model used in most of the United States. Documents are recorded in chronological order; subsequent purchasers are presumed on notice; chain of title is searched back to a marketable starting point. The Land Court system, unique to Hawaii, is a Torrens-style registered title system. When property is brought under Land Court, the court issues a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT); the title shown on the TCT is conclusive against the world, eliminating most chain-of-title disputes. A property may be entirely in the Regular System, entirely in Land Court, or split (a \"dual\" parcel). Agents must know which when ordering title and preparing closing.",
      "HARPTA (Hawaii Real Property Tax Act) is a state withholding requirement. When a non-Hawaii resident sells Hawaii real property, the buyer must withhold a percentage (currently 7.25% as of recent rules — verify current rate) of the gross sales price at closing and remit it to the State. This is a withholding against the seller's eventual Hawaii income tax liability, not an additional tax. The seller may apply for a reduced or zero withholding by filing forms in advance. Buyers are statutorily responsible — failure to withhold makes the buyer liable. FIRPTA is the federal counterpart, requiring 15% withholding on sales by foreign sellers; both can apply to the same transaction.",
      "GET (General Excise Tax) is Hawaii's tax on business activity, including real estate brokerage commissions and most rental income. It is not a \"sales tax\" — it falls on the gross receipts of the business and is typically passed to the customer as a \"GET visible pass-on.\" Real estate licensees must factor GET into their commissions and disclose appropriately. Property managers must collect GET on rents (with passthrough by tenant) and remit. The 2026 rate is 4% statewide plus county surcharges in some counties; verify current rates.",
      "Conveyance tax is Hawaii's state-level transfer tax on real property sales. It has tiered rates based on sale price and buyer status (owner-occupant rate is lower than investor rate). The seller typically pays unless contract specifies otherwise. Recording fees are separate, charged by BOC or Land Court per page recorded. These are exam math territory — be prepared for calculation questions on the proper conveyance tax tier.",
      "The Seller's Property Disclosure Statement is required by HRS 508D for residential resales of one to four units. The seller must disclose all known material facts about the property's condition. The disclosure form covers known defects in roof, plumbing, electrical, structural, environmental hazards, drainage, prior repairs, and known issues with the unit, the building, the lot, and the immediate neighborhood. Buyers who receive a materially inaccurate disclosure have rescission rights subject to statutory deadlines.",
      "Leasehold disclosures are uniquely important in Hawaii because so much property is leasehold. HRS 514E and other statutes require disclosure of the remaining lease term, current lease rent, scheduled lease rent step-ups (renegotiation dates), and any reversion of improvements at lease end. A buyer who doesn't know they're buying leasehold can sue. Distressed-property and short-sale disclosures are required when applicable. The Condominium Public Report (developer disclosure document) must accompany sales of new condo units.",
      "Environmental conditions specific to Hawaii: lava-zone classification (Hawaii County 1-9 hazard rating), flood zones (especially low-lying coastal areas), tsunami evacuation zones, hurricane-zone wind ratings (insurance impact), agricultural pesticide history (especially on former plantation lands), formaldehyde concerns from prior pesticide treatments, and termite inspection (most resales include a Termite Inspection Report, often called a \"termite\" report or pest control report). Coastal property has SMA (Special Management Area) considerations. Ag land has restrictions on residential use.",
      "Hawaii land history affects property rights in unique ways. The Mahele of 1848 began the conversion from communal to fee ownership. Royal Patent Grants and Land Commission Awards from this era still appear in chain of title. Some properties have kuleana rights — descendants' continued access for cultivation, gathering, or burial sites. The Native Hawaiian Inheritance Act and Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA) govern Hawaiian Home Lands, which are leased only to qualifying Native Hawaiians and have specific transfer restrictions. These legacy issues occasionally surface in transactions.",
      "Tax Map Key (TMK) is Hawaii's parcel identifier. It has the format Zone-Section-Plat-Parcel(-CPR), e.g., 1-2-3-456-7890. Each county uses its own zone numbering. For Condominium Property Regimes (CPR), additional digits identify the specific unit. TMKs link to county tax assessment, zoning, real-property tax payments, and recorded documents. Always confirm the TMK matches the legal description before any transaction."

  {
    "slug": "hi-types-of-ownership",
    "intro": "Hawaii is condo-heavy and leasehold-rich. The state portion tests these structures more than typical state exams.",
    "overview": [
      "Condominiums in Hawaii are governed by HRS 514B (the modern Condominium Property Act enacted in 2006) for new and most existing projects, with HRS 514A (the older statute) still applicable to many pre-2006 condos that haven't opted into 514B. Every condo project has a recorded Declaration (the foundational document creating the project), Bylaws (governance procedures), and House Rules (day-to-day rules adoptable and amendable by the board). The Association of Apartment Owners (AOAO) is the governing body — Hawaii's term for what mainland calls the condo HOA. Owners pay maintenance fees (\"monthly common element assessments\"); the AOAO can place liens on units for unpaid fees, with priority typically following recording rules.",
      "CPRs (Condominium Property Regimes) are a uniquely Hawaiian use of condominium law. A single house lot is carved into two or more \"units\" (typically two stand-alone houses on one parcel, or a primary + ohana unit) under a CPR declaration. Each unit gets its own TMK and can be sold separately. CPRs let two owners share a parcel without a partition action and without the higher cost of subdivision. They're common in older neighborhoods being incrementally densified, but they create complexity around maintenance allocation and lender willingness to finance.",
      "Leasehold is far more common in Hawaii than in mainland markets. Buyers acquire only the leasehold interest; the underlying land remains owned by the lessor (often a major Hawaiian-history landowner like Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, the State of Hawaii, or other large trusts). Lease terms run 30-75+ years with renegotiation provisions. The most critical agent disclosures: (1) remaining lease term, (2) current lease rent, (3) lease rent renegotiation dates and how new rent is determined (often a percentage of land value), (4) what happens to improvements at lease end (do they revert to the lessor, or is there a buyout). A leaseholder approaching renegotiation faces possible dramatic rent increases — an unprepared buyer may suddenly owe multiples of prior lease rent.",
      "Time share plans are governed by HRS 514E with extensive disclosure requirements. Buyers must receive a public report and have a 7-day right of rescission from contract signing — the buyer may cancel for any reason within seven days and receive a full refund. Hawaii has a separate Time Share Plan Manager license requirement. Aggressive time share marketing is heavily regulated. Resale of time shares is notoriously difficult — secondary market prices are often a tiny fraction of original purchase.",
      "Cooperatives are rare in Hawaii compared to condos. A few exist in Honolulu but the structure (own shares + proprietary lease, financing complications) hasn't taken hold here as it did in New York. Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) exist but are less common than condos because Hawaii's land scarcity and historic plantation patterns favored condo development.",
      "Land trusts exist in Hawaii for various purposes — affordable housing trusts, conservation trusts, family trusts holding ancestral land. The \"hui\" structure, traditional Hawaiian co-ownership often family-held across many heirs, can lead to partition complications when even one heir wants to sell.",
      "Common-interest community governance: The AOAO board has duties to all owners, must hold annual meetings, must keep records open to owners, and must act consistently with declaration and bylaws. Many disputes arise from board decisions on common-element repairs, special assessments, and house rule enforcement. Hawaii has detailed statutory protections for owners against board overreach.",
      "Buyer due diligence on common-interest property: review the project's budget and reserves, recent meeting minutes, special assessment history, pending litigation, current and projected maintenance fees, rules on rentals (some projects ban short-term, vacation rentals, or pets), and the project's Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac warrantability status (affects financing options). A \"non-warrantable\" condo is harder to finance because GSE-backed loans are unavailable."

    "overview": [
      "HRS 521 (the Residential Landlord-Tenant Code) covers most residential rentals in Hawaii — residential premises rented for dwelling purposes. Key tenant protections: a written rental agreement is required for terms over a year (Statute of Frauds), security deposit is capped at one month's rent (with separate allowance for pet deposits), security deposit must be returned within 14 days of move-out with itemized deductions (or full refund), notice for periodic-tenancy termination, and prohibitions against retaliatory eviction.",
      "Specific notice periods to memorize: 5-day notice for non-payment of rent (gives tenant 5 days to pay or vacate), 10-day notice for material breach that's curable (tenant has 10 days to cure or vacate), 28-day notice from tenant to terminate month-to-month (most common tenant exit), 45-day notice from landlord to terminate month-to-month or to raise rent, 5-day notice for landlord termination after non-payment notice expires, longer notices for fixed-term ends without breach.",
      "Eviction (called \"summary possession\" in Hawaii) requires court order. Self-help eviction — changing locks, removing belongings, cutting utilities, threats to vacate — is illegal and creates statutory damages payable to the tenant (often actual damages plus a multiple plus attorney fees). Landlord must follow the formal process: serve proper notice → file complaint in district court → obtain judgment → engage sheriff for actual removal if tenant doesn't vacate.",
      "Disclosures and required practices: lead-paint disclosure (federal, pre-1978 housing), security-deposit accounting at move-out, written notice of contact information for landlord/agent, written notice of rent increases (45 days for month-to-month). Landlord must maintain habitable premises (HRS 521 includes warranty of habitability), make timely repairs after notice from tenant, and comply with building codes. Tenant has rights including to repair-and-deduct in some situations and to terminate for landlord's material breach of habitability.",
      "A property manager managing rental property for compensation must hold a Hawaii real estate broker license. Salespersons may assist under broker supervision but cannot independently manage. Trust account rules from HRS 467 + HAR Title 16 Chapter 99 apply rigorously to property managers: tenant security deposits must be held in a separate trust account, separate from the broker's operating funds, properly identified, reconciled regularly. Mishandling deposits is one of the top three license-revocation triggers.",
      "Commercial property management (governed by lease contract more than statute) typically follows different rules. HRS 521 generally does not apply to commercial leases. Commercial tenants have less statutory protection and greater contract freedom. PMs handling commercial property should clearly distinguish residential from commercial accounting and disclosure practices.",
      "Vacation rental and short-term rental (STR) regulation is increasingly significant. Each Hawaii county has its own STR rules — Honolulu has some of the strictest, requiring registration, limiting locations, and capping rental terms. Operating an unregistered STR can trigger fines and permit denial. Property managers must verify legal status before listing or managing any vacation rental."

    "overview": [
      "The State Land Use Commission (LUC) classifies all Hawaii land into four districts: Urban, Rural, Agricultural, and Conservation. This is the primary classification — county zoning operates within state districts. Urban district allows the highest density development; Conservation is the most restrictive. Boundary changes require petition to LUC, public hearings, and substantial justification.",
      "Conservation district is the most heavily restricted, with development requiring a Conservation District Use Permit (CDUP) from the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). Most ordinary residential or commercial development is forbidden in Conservation. Forest reserves, mountain wilderness, watershed areas typically fall here. Reclassification to allow development is rare and politically contested.",
      "Agricultural district covers the largest land area in Hawaii (former plantation lands, ranches, etc.). Residential development on Ag is permitted but with significant restrictions: typically one dwelling per minimum lot area (varies by county), use must be agriculturally compatible, often a \"farm dwelling\" requirement requiring genuine agricultural activity. Buyers of \"ag\" homes should verify they aren't living in violation of agricultural-use requirements.",
      "County zoning is the second tier. Each of Hawaii's four counties (Honolulu/Oahu, Hawaii/Big Island, Maui, Kauai) has its own zoning ordinance. Honolulu uses the Land Use Ordinance (LUO). Each county has standard residential, commercial, industrial, mixed-use, and special districts, with detailed standards on density, setbacks, height, parking, lot coverage. Variances and special permits are issued by county boards.",
      "Special Management Areas (SMAs) are coastal-zone areas where development is heavily regulated under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). Any \"development\" within an SMA — broadly defined to include construction, demolition, grading, change of use, even some additions — requires an SMA permit from the county planning department. The line between minor and major SMA permits depends on scale and impact. SMAs typically extend roughly to the 350-foot setback from the high tide line, but boundaries vary.",
      "Restrictive covenants (CC&Rs) and HOA rules layer on top of county zoning. Many older neighborhoods (especially planned developments from the 1970s-90s) have strict architectural rules, paint colors, fence heights, and landscaping requirements. Race-restrictive covenants from earlier eras are unenforceable but often still appear in title chains — Hawaii recognizes them as void but agents should know the issue.",
      "Subdivision in Hawaii follows county subdivision ordinances. Major subdivisions require formal platting, infrastructure dedication, environmental review, often public hearings. Minor subdivisions and consolidations are simpler. CPR can sometimes accomplish similar densification goals without formal subdivision."

Regular System uses the Bureau of Conveyances chain-of-title model — recording protects subsequent purchasers, chain is searched back to a marketable starting point, and clouds are resolved through ordinary title actions. Land Court uses the Torrens model: a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) is conclusive against the world. Once a parcel is registered in Land Court, ownership cannot be challenged outside the registration system except in narrow statutory exceptions. Most older Hawaii title work involves checking which system the parcel is in.",

Joint tenancy with right of survivorship — must use the express language \"as joint tenants with right of survivorship\" or substantially equivalent words; survivorship eliminates probate of that interest. Tenancy by the entirety — only available to married couples (and same-sex married couples), with both survivorship and protection from individual-spouse creditors on the marital home.",
      "Liens in Hawaii: real property tax liens take priority over almost everything except prior recorded mortgages on Land Court parcels (Land Court rules differ slightly). Mechanic's liens (HRS 507) protect contractors, suppliers, architects, and design professionals for unpaid work or materials — must be filed within statutory time limits. AOAO liens for unpaid maintenance fees in condos take their priority based on recording. State and federal tax liens follow recording priority within their classes. Judgment liens attach when a judgment is recorded.",
      "Foreclosure in Hawaii has two paths. Judicial foreclosure is court-supervised: lender files complaint, court issues judgment, property sold at court-confirmed auction. Slower (often 12-18 months) but with more borrower protections. Non-judicial (power-of-sale) foreclosure — used when the security instrument contains a power-of-sale clause — is faster, governed by the Mortgage Foreclosure Act's notice and auction procedures (HRS 667). Hawaii also has alternate Mortgage Foreclosure Dispute Resolution (MFDR) for owner-occupied homes, requiring the lender to engage in dispute resolution before non-judicial foreclosure.",
      "Quiet title actions are court proceedings to resolve title clouds and confirm ownership. Common in Hawaii where chain-of-title issues from the Mahele era, undocumented family transfers in older neighborhoods, or unrecorded deeds create disputes. Adverse possession is recognized in Hawaii but the requirements are stringent: open, notorious, hostile, exclusive, continuous occupation for the statutory period (varies; 20 years is a common figure for Hawaii but verify current).",
      "Estates in Hawaii: standard fee simple, life estate (can be created in deed or will), leasehold (40-65 year residential leases common, longer for commercial), Hawaiian Home Lands (federal HHCA-restricted), and special homestead exemptions for primary residence. The state's old \"ahupuaʻa\" land divisions occasionally surface in older deeds and modern conservation/Native Hawaiian rights cases.",

Conveyance tax is paid by the seller (typically) at closing, calculated as a tiered rate on sale price with reduced rates for owner-occupant buyers and homestead exemptions.

    "overview": [
      "The Hawaii Association of REALTORS® (HAR) publishes the most-used standard residential purchase contract — the Deposit Receipt Offer and Acceptance (\"DROA\"). Every Hawaii agent should be able to read it cold and identify each section: parties, property, price, deposit, financing, closing date, contingencies (inspection, financing, appraisal, condo docs review), prorations, conveyance tax, escrow, signatures. The DROA is a starting template — modifications require careful drafting and ideally attorney review for non-standard terms.",
      "Required addenda by transaction type. Lead-based paint addendum for pre-1978 housing (federal). Seller's Real Property Disclosure Statement under HRS 508D. Condominium Public Report addendum for new condo sales (developer disclosure). HAR's lead-based paint addendum, often combined with the federal form. As-is addendum if applicable. Various contingency addenda — inspection, appraisal, financing, sale-of-buyer's-current-home. Counter-offer forms when responses change material terms.",
      "Listing agreements in Hawaii follow standard categories: Exclusive Right to Sell (most common), Exclusive Agency, Open Listing. The HAR listing agreement form covers commission rate, term, listing price, agent obligations, seller obligations, MLS authorization, and dispute resolution. Net listings are generally avoided due to conflict-of-interest concerns.",
      "Dual-agency consent forms (Form RR105C or current equivalent) are mandatory in Hawaii before any dual representation begins. The form explains the consumer's options: representation by seller's agent, representation by buyer's agent, dual agency (with informed consent), or customer status (no representation). The form must be delivered \"before any substantive interaction\" — practically, before showings or any negotiation. Designated-agency arrangements within a brokerage are also typical and require their own disclosure.",
      "Common contract pitfalls: failing to specify whether contingencies are passive (\"expires unless objected to within X days\") or active (\"requires written notice to remove or contract terminates\"); failing to state whether closing date is \"time of the essence\"; ambiguity on who pays which closing costs (some traditional Hawaii allocations differ from mainland); missing addenda that void disclosure protection; failing to identify the proper TMK including any CPR designation.",
      "Counter-offers on the standard HAR form preserve all unchanged terms. Multiple counters can occur. Each counter resets prior offers — the most recent counter is the live one. \"Acceptance\" of a counter must be unconditional; a further change is itself a new counter. Time to respond is governed by the form's terms (often 24-72 hours).",
      "Earnest money deposit handling: typically held in the listing brokerage's trust account or by the escrow company. Hawaii custom is to deposit with escrow rather than the listing brokerage in most resale transactions. Failure to deposit promptly can void the contract and creates broker liability.",
      "Distressed property and short-sale contracts add layers: lender approval contingencies, additional disclosures, longer timelines, often \"subject to lender approval\" language. Hawaii also has Distressed Property Conveyance (DPC) protections under HRS 480E for certain transactions involving residences in default."

    "overview": [
      "Agreement of Sale (\"AOS\") is a Hawaii-flavored installment land contract. The buyer takes possession but legal title stays with seller until purchase price is paid. Common when a buyer can't qualify for conventional financing, in leasehold-conversion deals where lender financing is unusual, or for unique properties. AOS is recordable and creates an equitable interest in the buyer. Default remedies typically follow the contract terms but generally require notice and a cure period; harsh forfeiture is disfavored.",
      "Purchase Money Mortgage (PMM) is seller financing where the seller takes back a mortgage instead of all-cash. Common in Hawaii for high-end and unique properties where conventional lenders are slow or skeptical. The PMM is junior to any senior institutional financing and creates a recorded lien against the property. Common terms: 30-year amortization, 5-15 year balloon, market interest rate.",
      "Hawaii institutional lenders include local credit unions (HSFCU, Aloha Pacific FCU, others), Bank of Hawaii, First Hawaiian Bank, Central Pacific Bank, plus mainland-headquartered banks and online lenders. Local lenders often have better insight into leasehold deals, condo project warrantability, and CPR quirks. Many condo projects are non-warrantable for Fannie/Freddie and require a portfolio lender.",
      "Hawaii has a usury statute (HRS 478) capping consumer loan interest. Most institutional loans are exempt from the statutory cap (federal preemption + statutory exemption), but the cap matters mostly in private lending and seller financing. Verify the current cap and exemption rules; statutes update.",
      "FHA, VA, and USDA loans are available in Hawaii but with state-specific caveats. FHA condo project approval is required — many Hawaii condos are not FHA-approved. VA loans work in Hawaii but the VA appraisal can be conservative on leasehold properties. USDA rural housing applies to specific eligible areas, more limited in Hawaii than mainland.",
      "Closing costs in Hawaii: conveyance tax (state), recording fees, escrow fee, title insurance, lender fees, prorated taxes and condo fees, prepaid insurance and interest. Some allocations differ from mainland custom — agents should reference HAR's standard closing-cost allocation for guidance and customize per contract.",
      "Lease conversion: the process of buying out the underlying fee on a leasehold property. Often complex, requiring lessor cooperation (sometimes legally compelled under certain statutes), professional appraisal of fee value, financing arrangement for the fee purchase, and recording of the deed-in-fee.

    "intro": "Hawaii is an \"escrow state\" — a neutral escrow holds everything and disburses on closing.",
    "overview": [
      "In Hawaii, virtually all residential real estate transactions go through escrow. The escrow agent (a licensed escrow company under HRS 449 — Hawaii Escrow Depositories statute) is a neutral third party holding funds, deeds, and instructions. Escrow opens with the executed purchase contract and earnest money deposit. Escrow closes only when all conditions are satisfied: inspection waivers or repair completions, financing commitments, title clearance, signed deed, buyer's funds, payoff of seller's loans, and any required disclosures, releases, and approvals.",
      "The escrow agent's duties are strictly defined by escrow instructions agreed by both parties. The agent is NOT a party advocate — it's neutral. It cannot disburse funds without proper authority, cannot release the deed without payment, and cannot waive contract conditions. Escrow officers handle title searches, prepare closing documents, calculate prorations, coordinate with lenders and title insurers, and ultimately fund and record the transaction.",
      "Closing statements summarize every credit and debit. Modern closings use the federal Closing Disclosure form for residential mortgage loans (replaces HUD-1 for TRID-covered loans). Items include sales price, deposits, loan proceeds, prorations (taxes, condo fees, lease rent), conveyance tax (often Hawaii line item), GET on commissions, escrow fee, title insurance premiums, recording fees, lender fees, and net to seller.",
      "Conveyance tax: Hawaii imposes a state-level transfer tax based on sale price and buyer category. Owner-occupant rates are lower than investor rates. The current schedule is tiered (rate per $100 of sale price, increasing at higher price brackets). Verify the current rate schedule annually — they update. The seller typically pays unless contract specifies otherwise. Failure to pay conveyance tax can void recording of the deed.",
      "Common Hawaii prorations: real property taxes (semiannual; July 1 to December 31 is one billing period), condo maintenance fees (monthly), lease rent (varies by lease — often quarterly or annually), tenant rents on income property. Hawaii contracts typically prorate using actual day count (365-day year), though contracts may specify 360-day banker's year. Confirm in contract.",
      "Title insurance in Hawaii: standard policies cover the typical risks. Owner's policy is a one-time premium protecting buyer for as long as they own. Lender's policy is required by lender, covers loan amount, decreases as loan balance drops. Hawaii title insurance carriers commonly include Title Guaranty, First American, Old Republic, others. Special endorsements address Hawaii-specific issues like leasehold and AOAO.",
      "Common closing-day issues: missing signatures or notarizations, last-minute lender conditions, failed wire transfers, undisclosed liens discovered at title pull, AOAO estoppel showing back fees owed. Smooth closings come from thorough pre-closing review and proactive communication among agents, escrow, lender, and title insurer."

    "intro": "HRS 467 + HAR Title 16 Chapter 99 are the bedrock of Hawaii license law. This section is the largest weight on the state portion (14 items).",
    "overview": [
      "Hawaii has two real estate license categories regulated under HRS 467: Salesperson and Broker. A Salesperson must be 18+, have a valid Social Security number, complete the 60-hour Salesperson Pre-Licensing Course at a REC-approved school, pass the PSI examination (national + state portions, 70%+ on each), be sponsored by a Hawaii-licensed real estate broker (an \"employing\" or \"sponsoring\" broker), and pay the licensing fees. A criminal background check applies; certain criminal histories can disqualify or require explanation. Salespersons may not collect fees directly from a customer — fees flow through their employing broker.",
      "A Broker must hold a current valid Salesperson license, have at least three years of active full-time experience as a salesperson within the prior five years (the experience requirement) along with a minimum number of completed transactions, complete the 80-hour Broker Pre-Licensing Course, pass the broker examination, provide additional documentation including evidence of experience, and pay the broker license fees. Brokers can practice independently as a sole-broker firm, supervise salespersons, or operate under a brokerage entity.",
      "Continuing education (CE) requirements: 20 hours every 2-year license cycle (the cycle ends on the last day of December of even-numbered years for individual licensees on the standard cycle; verify current). The 20 hours must include the state-mandated Core Course (typically 6 hours, updated each cycle to reflect law changes). The remaining hours come from approved electives. Late renewal incurs fees and possible inactive status. CE must be completed at REC-approved providers.",
      "Trust account rules under HRS 467 + HAR §16-99: client funds must be held in a Hawaii bank or savings institution, separate from the broker's operating account, properly identified (\"Trust Account\" or similar). Funds must be deposited promptly (typically 2 business days). Records must be retained for the period state rules require (commonly 3 years). Monthly reconciliation is standard. Audits by REC are unannounced. The penalties for trust-fund violations are severe — typically license revocation, sometimes felony charges.",
      "Disciplinary grounds under HRS 467: misrepresentation or fraud in transactions, commingling, conversion, undisclosed dual agency or other conflicts of interest, discrimination violating state or federal law, failure to supervise (broker), advertising violations, paying or receiving undisclosed referral fees in violation of RESPA, conviction of crime involving moral turpitude, drug or alcohol abuse impairing practice, and violation of any other duty imposed on licensees. The Real Estate Commission may revoke, suspend, fine, place on probation, require additional education, or impose other discipline. Civil and criminal liability layer on top of license discipline.",
      "Mandatory Agency Disclosure: Hawaii requires written agency disclosure to consumers before any \"substantive interaction\" — meaning before any showing, listing presentation, or detailed negotiation. The form (commonly known by its current code, historically RR105C; verify current form name) explains the consumer's representation options: Seller's Agent, Buyer's Agent, Dual Agent (with informed consent), or Customer (no representation). Failure to deliver the form on time is a license-law violation.",
      "Advertising rules under HAR §16-99: every ad must include the firm name as licensed (not just the agent's name). Out-of-state advertising for Hawaii property must comply. Internet advertising follows the same standards as print and broadcast. Cannot advertise as the listing broker on a property under another broker's exclusive listing. Cannot use misleading terms or imply qualifications not held. Team or group names are permitted only if certain disclosure rules are met. Photos and information must accurately represent the property and licensee.",
      "Procuring cause and commission disputes are common. Hawaii follows general principles: the agent who initiated the unbroken chain leading to the sale is typically the procuring cause. Disputes between cooperating brokers are often resolved through the listing broker's offer of cooperation in MLS. Hawaii REALTORS® can use NAR's arbitration process. Non-REALTORS® rely on contract terms and possibly civil litigation.",
      "Practicing within scope: salespersons cannot operate independently of their broker; cannot sign listing agreements in their own name; cannot accept fees directly. Broker liability is broad — the broker is responsible for all licensees affiliated with the firm, including independent contractors. Switching brokers requires release from the prior broker or appropriate procedures under HRS 467 and REC rules. Inactive licensees (those without an employing broker, or who haven't paid renewal) cannot list, show, negotiate, or be paid for real estate services."
